# Pomodoro Technique Scheduler

## Description

This program helps users to manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro Technique. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that breaks work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This scheduler allows users to define the number of Pomodoros they want to complete and generates a detailed schedule with focus periods and breaks. It is currently a simple command-line application, but future versions will include additional features and a GUI.

## Upcoming Features

- **Graphical User Interface:** A user-friendly GUI that will make it easier to input data and view the schedule.
- **Notifications:** Alerts to notify users when a focus period ends and a break begins.
- **Task Integration:** Ability to link tasks with specific Pomodoros for better task management.


## Example

Here's what running the program might look like:

```bash
